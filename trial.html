  <p>Senate will come to order. Senate will come to order. Sergeant-at-arms
will close the doors, members will go to their seats, members and guests
in the gallery will please silence all electronic devices.  Before we
get started today, let me remind all our guests in the gallery that the
senators that are before you on the floor today are your voice here on
all matters, and so they are the only ones we will be hearing from
today. So please, in the gallery, please stay silent and let your
senators speak on your behalf. Leading the senate in prayer today is
Reverend Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain. All members and guests in the
gallery will please stand. </p>
  <p>[SPEAKER CHANGE] Let us bow our heads and
pray. Oh mighty God, we thank you for fresh mercy that falls down every
morning. Through light heralds the beginning of a new day. In
thanksgiving for your faithfulness and constancy, we bring these prayers
before you today, Lord. We pray for clearheadedness today. We pray for
endurance. We pray that these senators might keep in mind those that
they serve. Keep all leaders here, especially those to my left and to my
right, from the deception of self-righteousness, and guide them in the
ways of humility. Alert us to the peace that we can impart on others,
which comes from your storehouse of blessing. Show each of us how to
walk this day in love, as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us, a
perfect offering. May the Lord bless us, keep away evil, and lead us to
eternal life. Amen. </p>
