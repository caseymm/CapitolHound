IMPORTING TRANSCRIPTS

After ssh into server

run:

cd webapps/capitol_hound python2.7 manage.py scraper transcript.html

# Each transcript should be named transcript.html since the python scraping script is looking for a file called transcript.html
# You do need to specify python2.7 when running the command, webfaction requires the version
------------------------

ELASTICSEARCH

If you need to restart elasticsearch:

cd elasticsearch-0.90.1
cd bin/elasticsearch bg

------------------------

MAIL/ALERTS

# Two scripts are running on cron right now. One script gathers saved user keywords (currently at 3:58 pm), and the other
sends an email alert to the user (currently at 4:00 pm)
# The time of the automated scripts can be changed with crontab -e
# The server is run on GMT, which is five hours ahead of EST
